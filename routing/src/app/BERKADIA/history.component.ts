  <h1>OUR HISTORY</h1>
<p>Berkadia’s history began in 1994, when GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation (GMACCM) was established as a separate operating unit of the GMAC Mortgage Group. GMACCM grew to become one of the largest commercial real estate finance companies in the industry, with operations in the United States, Mexico, Canada, Europe and Asia. 

In March 2006, an investor group led by affiliates of Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts & Co. (KKR), Five Mile Capital Partners, LLC and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners completed the acquisition of a majority interest in GMAC Commercial Holding Corp. The company then changed its name to Capmark Financial Group Inc. (Capmark) and established a new executive team. 

In December 2009, Berkshire Hathaway and Leucadia National Corporation (LUK) acquired Capmark’s North American loan origination and servicing business forming Berkadia. Through acquisition, Berkadia has deepened its expertise in multiple products and asset classes, and added investment sales and research capabilities of the former Hendricks & Partners creating the company we operate today.</p>
