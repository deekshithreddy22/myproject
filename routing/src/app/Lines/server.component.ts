When you work with Berkadia, you work with a leader. And no matter what type of servicing you need, our team of professionals has the knowledge and resources to help.

<h1>THE SERVICER'S SERVICER</h1>

Berkadia is a leading commercial loan Fee-For-Services provider. Our mission is to provide the highest-quality and most efficient third-party loan servicing to institutional lenders by employing dedicated, experienced real estate professionals who are supported by the latest systems and technology. 

As a Berkadia client, you can outsource all your commercial loan servicing needs or select specific services to be performed either in your name or in Berkadia’s. Under the private label option, commercial mortgage servicing functions, websites and communications are performed in the lender’s name. 

Clients consistently benefit from our servicing solutions because they are able to capitalize on our management experience, technology and economies of scale. Berkadia also offers a cost-efficient alternative to maintaining a proprietary servicing platform for institutional lenders who can leverage our management experience, expertise and technology.
For these services we offer the following benefits:
SSAE-16-compliant workflow processes and controls
Property surveillance/discounted cash flow models
Internet access to loan and property information
Secure data in a SysTrust-certified systems environment
USAP
CMBS

As a master servicer, Berkadia assumes responsibility for the servicing and administration of all mortgage loans contained in a mortgage-backed securitization. We also handle all cash management functions as required by the particular pooling and servicing agreements.

Berkadia is responsible for making accurate and timely remittances to our clients or trustees and distributing periodic reports to the trustee and rating agencies. We ensure diligent loan payment collection and oversight of each primary or sub-servicer and provide P&I and servicing advances for CMBS.

As a primary servicer, Berkadia is responsible for cash management, escrow administration, financial statement analysis, property inspections, loan administration, surveillance and underwriting. We also provide portfolio, transaction and loan-level reporting to keep you on track.
