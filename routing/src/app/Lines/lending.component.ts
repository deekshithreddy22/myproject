For certain transactions, Berkadia will originate loans for its own balance sheet. Berkadia's proprietary lending strategy focuses on providing solutions where traditional lending sources cannot provide a product to meet the needs of our client. Berkadia has a highly skilled team of finance professionals who work with Berkadia’s production teams to create these lending solutions. Berkadia does not adopt a “one size fits all” approach, but rather will customize each transaction to the business plan and strategy of the customer. 

Due to its focus on providing loan products that are less readily available in the market, Berkadia typically originates floating rate bridge loans for commercial real estate assets that are being re-capitalized or re-positioned. These products provide the time and capital needed for our clients to maximize the value of their assets. When full value is achieved, Berkadia has the expertise and insights to help clients evaluate and secure the best long-term, fixed-rate option for their permanent financing needs.`
